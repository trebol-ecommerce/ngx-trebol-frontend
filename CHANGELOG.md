## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Adapting to Trebol API v3
  - Remove classes `Customer` and `Salesperson` in favor of `Person`
    - As a result, in both cases, reference tokens to personal information are shorter
      - `customer.person.firstName` -> `customer.firstName`
  - Rename all instances of the word `Sell` to `Order`
    - Angular components
      - `SellDetailsTableComponent` -> `OrderDetailsTableComponent`
      - `SellInformationComponent` -> `OrderInformationComponent`
      - `SellDetailUnitsControlComponent` -> `OrderDetailUnitsControlComponent`
      - `ManagementSalesComponent` -> `ManagementOrdersComponent`
      - `ManagementSellReviewDialogComponent` -> `ManagementOrderReviewDialogComponent`
    - Angular services
      - `ManagementSalesService` -> `ManagementOrdersService`
      - API services for sales data in both `http` and `local-memory` modules
    - File, class, property, function, constant and variable names
    - Endpoints
      - `/sales` -> `/orders`
      - `/sales/confirmation` -> `/orders/confirmation`
      - `/sales/rejection` -> `/orders/rejection`
      - `/sales/completion` -> `/orders/completion`
    - `SellDetail` to `OrderDetail` as well
  - Change Observable return types to `void` in API services for requesting with `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` verbs
    (which will return no response body with `201` and `204` codes)
    - NOTE: Should `PATCH` methods be supported, the same should apply!
- API architecture
  - Within their respective modules, API service classes were put together
    instead of being grouped "by aspect"
  - The `IEntityDataApiService.fetchPage` method signature was altered, and its 5 parameters
    were combined into a single separate interface type.
  - The HTTP implementation of the API also had another method with a similar signature,
    `makeHttpParams`. It was refactored as a separate function.
  - In the HTTP module were also several abstract classes to save writing boilerplate code.
    These were removed because calling HTTP APIs in itself is pretty straightforward and
    doesn't warrant the need for inheritance like this.

## [v2.12.1-rc.3] - 2022-08-02

### Changed

- Update dependencies

## [v2.12.0-rc.2] - 2022-05-02

### Added

- Environment variables
  - Interval in miliseconds to check for current token validity
  - Default product image URL
- Experimental startup loading spinner

### Changed

- `AppService` is replaced by three smaller, more specialized services
  - `SessionService` - knows (but does not tell) where to save session tokens; knows whether the user has an active one; and allows to fetch (and cache) authorization details
  - `AuthenticationService` - allows to login as user (or guest) and register, and to cancel any ongoing instance of these processes
  - `ProfileService` - allows to fetch (and cache) the current user's profile data, and to update it as well
- `ManagementHeaderComponent` refactored down to simpler components
  - Introduced a common `HeaderBrandComponent` used in both store and management pages
- Reorganized most form components into accordingly named `forms/` directories
- Frontpage lists show a paginator only when they have more than one page
- Make better use of some shared components to display details of carts/sales
  - `StoreCartContentsTable` superseded by `SellDetailsTable`
- In the sales management page, a new button triggers the dialog where clerks may view its details
- Checkout-related components (in the `store` module) split & rewritten against model classes using self-evident nomenclature
  - `StoreCheckoutRequestFormComponent` has a form that accepts instances of `CheckoutRequest`
  - `StoreBillingDetails` has a form that accepts instances of `BillingDetails`
  - And so forth
- Among other minor changes and refactors

### Fixed

- (UI) User name and details would not always be correct or up-to-date
  - (Performance) Make better use of existing auth HTTP APIs
- (UI) Contents of cart would be editable after confirmation
- (UX) After registration (and automatic login), the user would not retain profile info (namely their username)
- (UI) Readjusted spacing of product cards in frontpage catalog
- (UI) Set defined height for registration and guest login dialogs (for better use in mobile devices, where usually a virtual keyboard blocks the view)
- (UX) Allow mobile devices to "tab" correctly in nested forms (when pressing 'Next')
- (UX) Fetching initial sales data into the management page
- (UX) Keep auth status up-to-date and centralized, without calling the API from multiple sources
- Using actual instances of `InjectionToken<T>` to provide external API services
- And several minor bugfixes

### Removed

- Unused components related to file upload (which may be included if the feature ever gets to the external API specification)
- Sales data cannot be edited from the management module, as the `SellFormComponent` is no longer included
  - This may be reverted in future versions

## [v2.12.0-rc.1] - 2022-03-25

### Added

- Service interface methods specific to sales data API
  - `markAsConfirmed` - To acknowledge an order/sell and notify the customer - HTTP `/data/sales/confirmation`
  - `markAsRejected` - To prevent an order/sell to be delivered due to issues and/or refund the customer - HTTP  `/data/sales/rejection`
  - `markAsCompleted` - To mark an order/sell as delivered - HTTP  `/data/sales/completion`
- Components to display sell data
  - Simple block for general data
  - Table to only display details (products/units/subtotal of each)
  - Dialog component for reviewing all information. Can be accessed by clicking sales management page table rows
    - Includes button to view the receipt of the transaction, only if, and once it has been, paid
    - Three buttons are included in the dialog, each of them acts as interface for the above mentioned interface methods for the sales data API
- Simple component for Google Maps iframe embeds
  - Includes pipe for trusting external resource urls (uses `DomSanitizer`)
- Search bar component for the frontpage header
- Search products page
  - Can be accessed by clicking on the aforementioned search bar
  - Allows filtering by category and/or product name
- Parameterizable content on the frontpage (settings can be configured using `environments`)
  - Site logo
  - Location map (at the bottom; uses above mentioned Google Map iframe embed)
  - Banners (top and bottom of the page)
  - Floating WhatsApp button
  - Contact information in footer (email, phone number)
- Two-way binding of state and query params in frontpage. Implemented states are:
  - Searching products by name and/or by category

  - Slideshows images now may be able to hold links to redirect users to

### Changed

- Bump Angular to v13.3
- Refactored architecture for inserting and updating data within the management module
  - Removed `FormGroupOwner` pseudo-interface
  - Introduced `EntityTypeNames` type
  - Introduced `EntityFormGroupFactoryService`; specializes in creating entity-specific `FormGroup`s
    - Takes an instance of the aforementioned type
  - All entity forms do not have `FormBuilder` injected to them; instead, any required `FormGroup`s can be passed through an `@Input` decorator
    - When none is provided, these form components can fall-back to using the aforementioned service
  - `EntityFormDialog` will invoke an entity form through its HTML template, not through an inner directive with `ViewContainerRef.createComponent`
    - Updated signature for `EntityFormDialogData`
- `DataManagerComponentDirective<T>` now exposes `items$` as `Observable<any[]>` instead of `Observable<T[]>`
- When adding images, `code` field is now optional
- Hide frontpage heading
- Replace title in frontpage header with search bar
- `AppService` now exposes an `userName$` observable
- Refactored receipt page to have its card as a separate component

- Product cards hovered in frontpage use vertical gradient as a background instead of a solid color
- Renamed `ITransactionalProductListContentsDataApiService`
- `SlideshowComponent` now integrates with Angular forms

### Fixed

- Modules/chunks are now effectively lazy-loaded, decreasing app loading times enormously!
- Individual item fetching in HTTP API (used when editing any data)
- Change property type of `token` in `Sell` model to `string`
- Missing (optional) property `unitValue` in `SellDetail` model
- Missing references in fake APIs
  - Sales data
  - Account profile
- Logic for fetching receipt data
- Several issues with responsive screens in frontpage
- Going backwards in a slideshow would omit the first index
- Prematurely end guest sessions
- Errors in products CRUD operations
  - (UI) Image associations were not loaded into the form
  - (Form validation) Categories were required at parent-form and child-form levels
  - (HTTP API) Image associations were not included in request bodies
  - (HTTP API) Filtering by partial name would send an incorrectly-named query parameter
- Do not state a limit amount of items when fetching product categories; due to their tree-like nature these must not be 'paginated'
- Add more loading indicators in the frontpage
  - Product lists
- Alignment of some components
  - Acept/cancel buttons in dialog to select multiple products
  - Fields in personal information form
  - Size adjustment of frontpage product lists (use appropiate space when there are fewer products in a list)

- Interface to upload images in management module not creating any data
  - There is no available API for uploading images; use a plain-text form as fallback

### Removed

- Old `localhost.proxy.conf.json` used to bypass CORS e.g. for servers running in localhost
  - Angular still guides users on how to create these, but it's not a good practice
  - Servers should always have CORS enabled and configured so that JavaScript apps can access them (see <https://enable-cors.org/>)
